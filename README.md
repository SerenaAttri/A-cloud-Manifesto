# What is cloud computing? 
Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services from applications to storage and processing power - typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis. In simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data over the internet instead of your computer hard drive.
# How does it work?
Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider. Ultimately, the 'cloud' is just a metaphor for the internet.
# Huge Benefits
**High Speed**<br>
We provide the ability to spin up new cloud computing instances in a matter of seconds to reshape the agility and speed of software development. Developers can easily test new ideas and design application architecture without the dependency on on-site hardware limitations or slow procurement processes.<br>
<br>
**Automatic Software Updates**<br>
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery rely on the fact that new software versions can be easily tested and deployed in the cloud environment, which allows for higher velocity of product innovation, releasing more and more features to the end-users on a monthly, weekly and in some cases even daily basis.<br>
<br>
**Efficiency and Cost Reduction**<br> 
By using cloud infrastructure, you don’t have to spend huge amounts of money on purchasing and maintaining equipment. This drastically reduces CAPEX costs and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). You don’t have to invest in hardware, facilities, utilities, or building out a large data center to grow your business.<br>
<br>
**Back-up and Restore Data**<br>
The fact that data can be stored in the cloud without capacity constrains also helps with backup and restore purposes. As end-users data changes over time and needs to be tracked for regulations or compliance reasons, we provide the means of storing older software versions for later stages, in cases they would be needed for recovery or rollback.<br>
<br>
**Disaster Recovery**<br>
Having previous versions of software stored in the cloud, and having production instances running on multiple cloud availability zones or regions we allow for faster recovery from disasters: if your application is deployed on multiple locations and for some reason one region goes down – the traffic can automatically failover to the working regions without any interruptions to the end-users.<br>
<br>
**Mobility**<br>
We allow mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop.<br>
<br>
**Control**<br>
Having control over sensitive data is vital to any company. You never know what can happen if a document gets into the wrong hands, even if it's an untrained employee.<br>
<br>
**Competitive Edge**<br>
We understand not every company will migrate to the cloud, at least not yet. However, organizations which adopt cloud find that many benefits that cloud offers positively impacts their business .<br>

# Conclusion 
Cloud computing adoption is on the rise every year, and it doesn’t take long to see why. Enterprises recognize cloud computing benefits and see how they impact their production, collaboration, security and revenue. By using a cloud-based solution, your enterprise can prevent a lot of problems that plague organisations that rely on on-premises infrastructure.<br>
